# 2015

After the 2014 season, Riot Games introduced a number of changes to competitive *League of Legends*. The number of teams in the League Championship Series was increased from 8 to 10 in both the North

America and Europe regions.[32] A second Riot Games official international tournament was announced, the Mid-Season Invitational, which took place in May 2015, and featured a single team from each

major region and one international wildcard.[33] Additionally, starting from 2015, all teams are required to field a head coach in their competitive matches, who will stay on stage and speak with the

team via voice-chat in the pick-ban phase of the game. This change makes the head coach an officially recognized member of the team.[34]

The 2015 World Championship concluded the 2015 season and was held at several venues across Europe in October 2015. Like the 2014 World Championship, the 2015 World Championship was a multi-city,

Series were unable to attend the event. [52]

All games leading up to the final were hosted in the Shanghai Media Tech Studio with no fans in

hosting a limited number of 6,312 fans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [53] The final was played on 31

"Kingen" Seong-hoon, was named the MVP of the series.[71] Their victory was considered a Cinderella

and underdog success story, as they had come from the play-in stage as Korea's fourth seed

representative, and had beaten some of the more favored and accomplished teams along the way,

inaugurated Worlds Qualifying Series between the fourth-seeded teams from the LEC and LCS.[74]

The format for the event differed to the previous editions, with the introduction of a play-in stage, consisting of eight teams who are split into two double elimination brackets. There, three teams

qualified to the second stage of the event where the qualifying teams, along with thirteen other teams, faced off in a swiss-system tournament to determine the qualifiers to the knockout stage, with

the eventual champions being crowned at the conclusion of the single-elimination knockout stage.[75]

Champions Korea (LCK).[76] In the final, TÄ± defeated Weibo Gaming 3-0, extending their record for the most world championships won by single team with four titles.[77] T1's top laner, Choi "Zeus"

Woo-je, was named the MVP of the series, while teammate Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok became the first player to win four World Championships.[78][79]

# 2024

The 2024 World Championship was held from 25 September to 2 November 2024, with the event taking place in three cities across Europe: Berlin, Paris and London. Twenty-two teams qualified to

participate at the World Championship based on placement within their own regional leagues and results gained in this years' Mid-Season Invitational (MSI), with the LCK and LPL's 4th seeds in the

Swiss stage reallocated to the winner and a team from the best performing region of the event.[b][80][81]

During the finals' broadcast of the 2023 World Championship, Riot Games announced that the finals of the 2024 edition of Worlds would take place in London at The O2 Arena on 2 November 2024.[82][83]

American band Linkin Park contributed the song "Heavy Is the Crown" as the tournament's anthem and performed live on the grand final stage in London.[84][85]

In the final, T1 defeated BLG 3-2, extending their record for most world championships won by a single team, with Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok becoming the first player to win five World Championships,

alongside the first to win 2 Finals MVPs.[86]

# 2025

Alongside news of Riot Games' extended sponsorship agreement with smartphone manufacturer OPPO, it was announced during the media day for the 2024 World Championship Final at The O2 Arena in London,

United Kingdom that China will host the 2025 League of Legends World Championship. It will be the country's third hosting of the tournament and the first since 2017 to take place in China without

travel restrictions as the 2020 edition was held in an "isolation bubble" due to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China. [87] It was later announced that the Final will be held in Chengdu, with

Beijing hosting both play-ins and swiss stages, and Shanghai hosting the quarterfinals and semifinals.[88]

This edition of the tournament is planned to feature 17 teams in total, with the MSI slots being kept and three teams from each of League's new competitive regions (Americas, EMEA, Korea, China and

Asia-Pacific) qualifying on top. One best-of-5 play-in match will be held before the Swiss stage between two teams.[89]

It will also be the first World Championship to adopt the Fearless Draft format, where teams cannot pick a champion that they've already played in a series, even if the opposing team already picked

that champion. While Fearless Draft was intended to only be used during the first split of the season, Riot Games announced prior to the final of the 2025 First Stand Tournament that it would apply

for the rest of the year, including MSI and Worlds, after it received "overwhelming" positive feedback during that period.[90] Fearless Draft will be used for all best-of-3 and best-of-5 series during

the World Championship. It is currently unclear if matches in the first two swiss stages will remain best-of-ones similar to the last two editions of the tournament or if a change will be enacted.
# Future

Riot Games announced on January 8, 2025 that the 2026 World Championship will be held in North America, while the 2027 edition will be held in South Korea.[91]
# Trophy

Riot Games, which owns *League of Legends*, commissioned the winner's trophy as the Summoner's Cup. Riot specified that it should weigh 70 pounds (about 32 kilograms), though the actual weight of the

finished cup was reduced so it would not be too heavy to lift in victory. The World Championship Cups for 2012 and for 2014 were created by Thomas Lyte,[92] who also make the FIFAe World CupTrophy and

the LEC Trophy.

In 2022, Riot Games announced the formation of a multi-year partnership with American jewelry brand Tiffany & Co., producing a newly designed Summoner's Cup with a weight of 44 pounds (about 20

kilograms).[93]
